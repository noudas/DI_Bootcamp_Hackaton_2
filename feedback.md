Jonathan and Gilan, 
Impressive work! Even though the project wasn’t fully finished, I can see the effort you put into it. 
While you didn’t fully follow the structure we learned in class, your code is still readable and quite clean. 
Although you weren’t able to successfully integrate the database, you still managed to deliver a really nice end result without it. 
However, if you had focused more on the critical aspects, you might have included fewer features but achieved a functional database.
Additionally, your interface could be more intuitive and explicit. 
As a new player, it’s not entirely clear what steps I need to take. 
Keep this in mind for future projects, and great job overall!
